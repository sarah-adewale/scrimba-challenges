// Given an array of positive numbers, write a function that returns the greatest product of any three numbers. 
// The approach of using three nested loops would clock in at O(N3), which is very slow. Use sorting to implement the 
// function in a way that it computes at O(N log N) speed. (There are even faster implementations, but weâ€™re focusing on using
// sorting as a technique to make code faster.)
